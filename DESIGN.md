# Turtleherder v2 — Design

A rewrite of the original PHP turtleherder as a React + Node app in TypeScript, backed by
Postgres. This document records the decisions made during the design interview
(July 2026) and is the spec for the first version.

## Goal

A **feature-complete copy of the original app**, shipped for real use. The legacy PHP in
`legacy/` is the reference for behavior. Deliberately deferred to later versions:

- Authentication / access control (currently anyone with the URL can view and edit)
- Improved calendar/date picking beyond the platform default
- Team creation & settings UI (self-serve signup)

The two structural flaws of the original are fixed now, not later:

1. **Table-set-per-team** (`bobcats_player`, `bobcats_game`, …) → a proper `team` table
   with foreign keys. Fully multi-team from day one; adding a team is an `INSERT`.
2. **PHP interleaved with HTML** → API server + React client with a typed contract.

## Architecture

- **Monorepo** in this repo, pnpm workspaces:
  - `client` — React SPA
  - `server` — API
  - `shared` — zod schemas + TypeScript types shared by both
- **Server:** Hono on Node (TypeScript). Plain JSON REST API. Request/response
  validation with zod via `@hono/zod-validator`; the same schemas type the client.
- **Client:** Vite + React + TypeScript. React Router for navigation, TanStack Query
  for all server state (fetching, caching, invalidation after mutations).
- **Database:** Postgres, accessed with **raw parameterized SQL via `pg`**.
  - All queries confined to one data-access module per resource, so row typing
    happens in exactly one place.
  - Schema migrations with **node-pg-migrate** — no ad-hoc SQL files.
- **Dev environment:** Postgres in Docker Compose; pnpm; config via env vars
  (12-factor, so a later deploy is unblocked). Local-only for now — no hosting
  decisions made yet.
- **Data:** fresh start. No migration from the live MySQL database; a seed script
  creates a bobcats-style demo team with players and games.

## Schema

- **team** — `id`, `name`, `slug` (unique, used in URLs), `min_players`,
  `min_quota_players`, `quota_label` (e.g. `"women"`), `timezone` (IANA name).
  Teams are created via seed script or SQL only in v1 (no admin UI).
  The original's hardcoded `min_players = 7` / `min_females = 2` become these columns.
- **player** — `id`, `team_id` FK, `name`, `counts_toward_minimum` (boolean).
  This quota-eligibility flag replaces the original's `gender` column: it models what
  the league actually checks (does this player count toward the women/gender-minimum
  rule) without modeling gender identity.
- **game** — `id`, `team_id` FK, `opponent_name` (nullable — `NULL` means bye week),
  `opponent_color` (nullable), `starts_at` (`timestamptz`).
  Times are true instants; the team's `timezone` is used for entry and display.
- **attendance** — `id`, `player_id` FK, `game_id` FK, `status` enum
  (`yes` / `no` / `not_sure`), unique on `(player_id, game_id)`.
  **Absence of a row means "hasn't responded."** Unlike the original, rows are *not*
  pre-created for every player × game; the schedule view LEFT JOINs the roster to
  render non-responders. This eliminates the original's insert-fanout on new
  players/games.

## Routes (client)

Mirrors the original's team-at-a-path URLs:

- `/:teamSlug` — schedule (home). Past/future game sections, roster report per game,
  **inline attendance editing** (yes/no/not-sure controls on each player row; mutation +
  query invalidation replaces the original's separate `changeattendance.php` page).
- `/:teamSlug/games/:gameId` — single game with the same inline controls. This is the
  **shareable link** a captain texts the team ("set your status for Sunday").
- `/:teamSlug/players` — roster management (list, add/edit/delete players).
- `/:teamSlug/games` — game management (list, add/edit/delete games).

Player form: name + quota checkbox. Game form: opponent name, color, and a native
`datetime-local` input (replaces the six dropdowns; the better calendar UX comes
later). Deletes use confirm dialogs instead of confirmation pages. The
"show/hide past games" toggle persists in localStorage (was a cookie).

## API (server)

REST under `/api`, team-scoped by slug. Roughly:

- `GET /api/teams/:slug` — team with settings
- `GET /api/teams/:slug/games` — games with attendance + roster report data
- `GET /api/teams/:slug/games/:id` — single game (backs the shareable page)
- `POST/PUT/DELETE` on games and players
- `PUT /api/teams/:slug/games/:gameId/attendance/:playerId` — upsert status

Exact shapes to be defined as zod schemas in `shared` during implementation.

## UX fidelity

- **Faithful recreation of the original look**: `legacy/bobcats/css/main.css` ported —
  green gradient, centered white card, purple links, color-coded statuses
  (green = coming, red = not coming, orange = not sure, black = no response).
- **The roster report keeps the original's grammar engine**: numbers as words,
  singular/plural handling, and the "we need **two** more players, **both** of whom
  must be women" constructions. The quota noun comes from `team.quota_label`, so the
  wording stays faithful for classic co-ed teams but works for any league rule.
  This logic lives in `shared` or `server` as pure functions — it is the most
  unit-testable code in the app.
- Bye weeks render as in the original ("Bye week." with no roster).

## Testing

Full pyramid:

- **Unit (Vitest):** roster-report grammar engine, date/timezone handling.
- **API integration:** Hono endpoints against a real test Postgres (Docker).
- **E2E (Playwright), a few flows:** mark attendance inline, add a game, add a player —
  chosen because the spec is "behaves like the original," and e2e is how that's checked.

## Decision log (from the interview)

| Decision | Choice | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Team modeling | Full multi-team, `team` table | Fixes flaw #1 completely |
| Team admin UI | None in v1; seed/SQL only | Settings are columns from day one |
| Data migration | Fresh start + seed data | Old MySQL schema is trivial to migrate later if ever needed |
| Deployment | Local dev only, 12-factor config | Hosting decided later |
| Repo layout | pnpm workspaces monorepo | `client` / `server` / `shared` |
| Server framework | Hono | zod-native, best TS inference |
| DB access | Raw SQL via `pg` | With node-pg-migrate + per-resource data modules as guardrails |
| API shape | REST + shared zod schemas | Debuggable with curl; schemas type both sides |
| Frontend | Vite + TanStack Query | React Router, SPA |
| Gender modeling | `counts_toward_minimum` flag + `quota_label` | Models the league rule, not identity |
| Attendance | Row = response; absence = no response | 3-state enum, unique (player, game) |
| Game times | `timestamptz` + team timezone | True instants, local display |
| Attendance UX | Inline on schedule **and** per-game shareable route | Replaces changeattendance.php |
| Date entry | Native `datetime-local` | Six dropdowns retired |
| Report copy | Original grammar engine, configurable quota noun | The app's soul, preserved |
| Styling | Faithful port of original CSS | 2010 look on purpose |
| Testing | Unit + API integration + Playwright e2e | |
| Dev env | Docker Compose Postgres + pnpm | |
| Legacy PHP | Moved to `legacy/`, kept as reference spec | Delete whenever |
